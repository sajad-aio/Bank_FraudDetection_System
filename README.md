# Bank_FraudDetection_System
This project is a Fraud Detection Web Application built with Flask. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model (filename.pkl) to predict fraudulent transactions. The web interface allows users to input transaction data and get real-time predictions about whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
